# Flag Guesser Mobile App

In this project, I developed an Android Mobile Application in Kotlin using Android Studio. The application is a Flag Guessing game implemented as a multiple choice quiz. The goal of the project was to learn how to develop multiple page applications in Kotlin with Android Studio. 

**User Flow:**
- User prompted for name at home screen before proceeding to quiz
- User answers 10 multiple choice questions
- After last question, user is sent to results page to see how many flags they guessed correctly
- User is returned back to home page
